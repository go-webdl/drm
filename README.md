# NO DRM IMPLEMENTATION HERE! ONLY ABSTRAT INTERFACE!

## What

It's a generalized interface for different types of CDM for WEBDL use. A remote CDM JSON-RPC client/server is included.

## Why

Provide a de-facto standard when it comes to CDM business. People with implementations and keys often want to keep them
private. A standardized remote CDM interface would help people sharing CDM as a service without giving out
keys/implementations.

## Contact

CDM implementation will never be published publicly, unless their parent company disclosed the implementation details.
Still, it's a hope to have everyone setup their CDM infrastructures securely, so there would be less key leaks and
revocations. In order to do that, CDM implementations will be shared through private channels.

To request source code of concrete CDM implementation conforming to this common interface, send your current
implementation as a proof that you are in business. Currently Widevine and PlayReady v2 CDM are ready for production
use. FairPlay Streaming CDM is in development stage. Helps are welcomed for collaboration on new CDM Reverse Engineering
and implementations.

**IMPORTANT: NEVER ASK FOR KEYS! WILL BLOCK YOU IF YOU DID!**
